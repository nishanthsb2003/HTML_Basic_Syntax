        I am passionate about the transformative power of technology and driven by a desire to create innovative solutions that can make a meaningful impact on society.
 
Currently, I am pursuing an undergraduate degree in Information Science and Engineering at AJ Institute of Engineering and Technology, Mangalore. My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, C, and C++, and I am expanding my expertise in web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. My hands-on experience includes developing a Swing application project and participating in workshops on IoT, robotics, and virtual labs.

In addition to my technical skills, I am committed to leadership and knowledge-sharing, which led me to create the NS_Engineer_Sathi YouTube channel. This platform allows me to guide and support fellow engineering students, sharing insights and academic resources. My diverse interests also include safety engineering, where I earned a BSS Diploma in Industrial Safety Engineering with distinction. This qualification reflects my dedication to applying safety practices in engineering, further enhancing my profile.

With a passion for continuous learning and innovation, I am excited to take on new challenges that align with my goal of contributing to societal development. Whether it's through creating technology-driven solutions for farmers or advancing safety standards, I am motivated to make a meaningful difference in both my professional and personal endeavors.
